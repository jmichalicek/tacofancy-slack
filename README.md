# TacoFancy Slackbot

This is the result of taking a week to play with Go and write a small app.  It is a slackbot which
works with the tacofancy api and, possibly, with the tacofancy github repository or a fork of it.


### TODO

* Test cases for everything
* Configuration file
* Documentation
* easter eggs!
