# TacoFancy Slackbot

This is the result of taking a week to play with Go and write a small app.  It is a slackbot which
works with the tacofancy api and, possibly, with the tacofancy github repository or a fork of it.

The recipes come from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy and https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api


### TODO

* Test cases for everything
* Configuration file
* Documentation
* easter eggs!
